# LSTM-Music-Generator
AI -generated music using LSTM network

You can directly run the [musicgen.ipynb](https://github.com/ninjacode01/LSTM-Music-Generator/blob/main/musicgen.ipynb) file in Google Colab, Dont forget to upload the [midi-files.zip](https://github.com/ninjacode01/LSTM-Music-Generator/blob/main/midi_files.zip) attached to your working directory in Colab.

We will generate some piano compositions using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. We will use some piano compositions from Chopin to be able to train our network. We will feed the network with MIDI files. These files are not audio files. They contain all the information, notes, chords, etc about a music composition, but they don't contain audio. Our network will be able to generate new MIDI files.

You can see a sample of generated music [music-output](https://github.com/ninjacode01/LSTM-Music-Generator/blob/main/test_output.mid)
